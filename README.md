# Card City
## Description 
This program allows a user to play against an Artifical Oppoenent in a game of Go Fish, Crazy Eight's or War. 
## Motivation
I created this project to create an application that allows users to play one of three cards of their choice against an aritfical opponenent. In addition, I wanted to test my ability to create code that deals with the compelxity of card games programs while also reusing as much code as possible. 
## Build Status
Finished with no plan to expand at this time. 
## Navigation
The app was created using Eclipse. Hence, the Java files can be found in *CardCity/src/*. 
## Style
When reading the code you will immediately notice the app was created with an object orientated approach that provides  encapsulation of objects like Card, BackImage, and PlayingStackofCards to name a few. In addition, multiple data structures such as queues and stacks were used.
## Installation
You can install the app by pulling the file and running it through you eclipse or running CardCity.exc
